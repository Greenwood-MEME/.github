Greenwood reduces the frequency of human elephant conflict with its early warning system.
MEME is a collaboration between University of Nottingham Malaysia and Department of Wildlife and National Parks of Peninsular Malaysia (PERHILITAN). It was founded in year 2011 by Prof Ahimsa Campos-Arceiz who has been researching Asian megafauna, particularly elephants, for more than 15 years now.
MEME‚Äôs general aim is to use science to develop an evidence-based approach to the conservation of Asian elephants in Peninsular Malaysia. Our specific objectives for the third phase of MEME are to:
- examine elephant behaviour and movement in conflict areas.
- identify model communities at varying scales to co-design HEC (Human Elephant Conflict) management strategies and monitor effectiveness.
- develope a communications plan for the various communities that face HEC, to channel findings to decision-makers in public and private sectors.
